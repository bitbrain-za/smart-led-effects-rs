# Neopixel Effects

This crate borrows heavily from [fastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED) and [tweaking4all](https://www.tweaking4all.com/hardware/arduino/adruino-led-strip-effects/).

## Dimensionality

Currently only works for strips/loops. But someday the plan is to extend it.


## Example Usage

```toml
[dependencies]
```

```rust
use smart_led_effects as effects;

```
